Little Chatter Box
=======
This is a chat test created during the HTRack (April 2015) and it is just a simple playtime with [socket.io](http://socket.io/)

### What you will need

You will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [express](http://expressjs.com/) installed. Install all dependencies with `npm install`.


Then just run `node app.js` and check your localhost on port 3000

Send messages... enjoy!

If you use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) you can share your localhost URL with others and chat! (or put in a server...)
