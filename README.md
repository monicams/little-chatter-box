Little Chatter Box
=======
This is a chat test created during the HTRack (April 2015) and it is just a simple playtime with [socket.io](http://socket.io/)

### What you will need

You will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [express](http://expressjs.com/) installed. Install all dependencies with `npm install`.


Then just run `node app.js` and check your localhost on port 3000

Send messages... enjoy!

For the avatars, I'm using [avatars.adorable.io](http://avatars.adorable.io/) which autogenerates an avatar based on the name/username with some great and simple call on the style of: `http://api.adorable.io/avatars/SIZE_HERE/NAME_HERE@adorable.io.png`

Example: 
![monicams avatar with adorable](http://api.adorable.io/avatars/100/monicams@adorable.io.png "monicams avatar with adorable")

If you use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) you can share your localhost URL with others and chat! (or put in a server...)
